"""Graph-aware ticket priority scoring for SWE Squad.

Replaces the simple severity-only sort with a multi-factor score
that considers knowledge graph relationships: similar ticket count,
cluster size, age, failed attempts, and whether a PR already exists.

Falls back gracefully to severity-only scoring when the knowledge
graph store is unavailable or has no data.
